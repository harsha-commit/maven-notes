## Steps involved in building a Java Project

- Compiling Source Code
- Run the tests
- Packaging files
- Deploying to server (not primary responsibility)

## Common Maven Goals

- Maven is based around the central concept of a build lifecycle
- That is the process for building and distributing a particular artifact (project) is clearly defined
- Each build lifecycles is made up of phases/ goals
- If a goal is selected, all it's previous goals in the lifecycle are also executed, before executing the current one

| Goal | Description |
| -- | -- |
| clean | removes all files generated by previous build |
| validate | validate the project and check if all neccessary info is available |
| compile | compile the source code of the project |
| test-compile | compile the test source code in test destination directory |
| test | run tests using a suitable unit testing framework |
| package | package the compiled code |
| verify | run any checks to verify if the package is valid and meets quality criteria |
| install | install the package into local repository |
| deploy | copies final package to remote repository |

## Build First Maven Project

1. Right click on the project, click on Run as, click Maven Build
2. Provide goal and run
